-- Data Modeling

/*
1. Understand the Requirements
	-- So many developers skip this step
    -- Most important step
    -- Slow and Takes Time
    -- But the better you understand the problem you're trying to solve
    -- Collect information

2. Build a conceptual model
	-- Identify entites, things, objects that have relationships
    -- Using this to communicate with stakeholders

3. Build a logical model
	-- Data structure for storing data
	-- Independent of database tech

4. Build a Physical Model
	-- Exact Data Types
    -- Default, Nullable, Primary Keys, Views, Stored Procs, Triggers
