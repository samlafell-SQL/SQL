-- Synchronizing a Model with a Database

/* In a big business we need scripts to build these DBs...

We have many environments in a large organization
1) Staging Environment
2) Testing Environment
3) Development Environment


So, when we edit the schema of the database... we need to use
'Synchronize', and then synchronize the new DB to different environments

While also copying the script that MySQL generates, putting it a file, and putting it under source control.
