-- Transactions

/*

A group of SQL statements that represent a single unit of work

Bank Transactions -- Transfer $10 from your account to your friend
Two operations -- Withdrawl and Deposit.
Both operations should complete successfully, and if not, neither operation should occur



ACID Properties


-- Atomicity: Unbreakable Transactions. Each transaction is 1 unit no matter how many statements there are.
-- Consistency: DB will remain in a consistent state.
-- Isolation: Protected from each other if the transactions modify the same data. Only 1 transaction at a time can update the samerows.
-- Durability: Changes made by transaction are permanent.
